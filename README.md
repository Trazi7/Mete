# Mete
In this project, my group and I were instructed to get creative with a platform styled game. The only restriction was that it must be a platformer, so the rest was up to us. 

#Planning process
My group, Charizard, decided that we wanted something open and entertaining. Artistically it would capture the gamers attention, and technically it would be fun to play. We also thought of diversity in the game and how we might implement all our ideas. 
The game would be a dungeon crawler! This would add to the mystery behind the game. It would even include a main character that our artists created. We wanted to have a character that was ours and had its own twist to it. The character had two different styles within the game. This way we were including both artists artwork. Visually, the change was implemented using portals. For instance, once our main character entered the first portal it changed to the next artistâ€™s character.
